# graphCoverStrategyEvaluationData
Data of the graph cover strategy evaluation

With the help of the script createDatasets.sh the datasets used in the evaluation are automatically created.

The queries used for the evaluation are stored in the folder queries.

The folder measurements contains the raw measurements that were recorded during the execution of the experiments.

The folder semanticWebJournal2018 contains the preprocessed and diagrams of the journal article and the same data from the iswc2018 paper are published in the folder iswc2018. Both folders contain the folders preprocessedMeasurments and diagrams.

The folder preprocessedMeasurements contains the raw measurements preprocessed with CEP. They can be used to create diagrams.

A huge number of diagrams that visualize most preprocessed values are stored in the folder diagrams.
